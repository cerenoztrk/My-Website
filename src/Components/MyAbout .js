            University with an associate degree in Computer Technology.
            Currently, I am studying Management Information Systems. I live in
            Istanbul. I have been developing in the front-end field for some
            time. I have the ability to solve problems. I want to specialize in
            my field in the industry and become the best programmer I can be. I
            consider myself successful in this area and I am ready to work to be
            even more successful in the future.

            <p>
              In frontend development, I know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
              languages. In addition, I am proficient in C# and Java. I also
              know the React.js framework as a UI library and am learning React
              Native. One of my recent goals is to acquire basic knowledge of
              PHP and also to have more backend knowledge.
